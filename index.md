Iâ€™m a C++ engineer specializing in distributed storage systems and real-time advertising architectures, currently translating selected technical articles from my Chinese CSDN blog (https://blog.csdn.net/treblez) into English. My goal is to share practical insights on high-performance systems, optimization strategies, and scalable infrastructure design with global audiences. Feel free to leave a comment below if you'd like to see specific topics covered!
